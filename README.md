# Integrated Bus Time Table System

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
using Jira, Confluence, and GitHub.

## Objective
To plan, track, document, and manage a software project using industry-standard
project management and version control tools.

## Tools Used
- **Jira**: Task planning, issue tracking, progress monitoring
- **Confluence**: Project planning, requirement documentation, SDLC reporting
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

## Jira Integration
All tasks, milestones, and issues are created and managed using Jira.
Task status is tracked using To Do, In Progress, and Done columns.

## Documentation
Project planning, SDLC phases, effort estimation, and progress reports
are created and maintained using Confluence.


## Project Description
The Integrated Bus Time Table System allows users to view bus schedules
and timings in a simple and organized manner.  
This project focuses on SDLC implementation rather than full application deployment.

## SDLC Phases Implemented
1. **Requirement Analysis** – documented in Confluence  
2. **Project Planning** – tasks and milestones created in Jira  
3. **Implementation** – basic project structure maintained in GitHub  
4. **Testing & Review** – task progress tracked in Jira  
5. **Documentation** – maintained using Confluence
